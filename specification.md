## Introduction

MARC and related formats such as PICA and MAB are used since decades as the basis for library automation. Several variants, dialects and profiles exist for different applications. The Avram schema language allows to specify individual formats for documentation, validation, and requirements engineering. The schema language is named after [Henriette D. Avram (1919-2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henriette_Avram) who devised MARC as the first automated cataloging system in the 1960s.

The Avram specification consists of a [schema format](#schema-format) based on JSON and [validation rules](#validation-rules) to validate [records] against individual schemas. The format can also be used to express results of record analysis. Avram schemas cover library formats based on MARC and PICA as well as simple key-value structures.

The document is managed in a git repository at <https://github.com/gbv/avram> together with test files for implementations.

### Conformance requirements

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

### Data types

A **string** is a sequence of Unicode code points.

A **single character** is a string consisting of exactely one Unicode code point.

A **timestamp** is a date or datetime as defined with XML Schema datatype [datetime](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime) (`-?YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss(\.s+)?(Z|[+-]hh:mm)?`) [date](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#date) (`-?YYYY-MM-DD(Z|[+-]hh:mm)?`), [gYearMonth](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#gYearMonth) (`-?YYYY-MM`), or [gYear](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#gYear) (`-?YYYY`).

A **regular expression** is a non-empty string that conforms to the [ECMA 262 (2015) regular expression grammar](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-patterns).  The expression is interpreted as Unicode pattern with `.` matching all characters, including newlines.

A **language** is a natural language identifier as defined with XML Schema datatype [language](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#language).

A **non-negative integer** is a natural number (0, 1, 2...)

An **URI** is a valid URI string according to [RFC 3986].

An **URL** is an URI starting with `http://` or `https://`.

A **range** is a sequence of digits, optionally followed by a dash (`-`) and a second sequence of digits with same length. The numeric values of each sequence are called **start number** and **end number**, respectively. The end number, if given, must be larger than the start number. Examples of valid ranges include `0`, `00`, `3-7`, `03-12`, and `01-09` but not `3-12` nor `7-2`. A string **matches** a range if it is a sequence of digits of same length as the sequence(s) in the range and the numerical value is equal to or within the start number and the end number of the range. Applications MAY accept and normalize sequences of different length to valid ranges.

### Records

[records]: #records
[record]: #records
[field]: #records
[tag]: #records
[occurrence]: #records
[format family]: #format-families

Avram schemas are used to [validate](#validation-rules) and analyze records. A **record** is a non-empty sequence of **fields**, each consisting of a **tag**, being a non-empty string and

* either a **flat field value**, being a string,
* or a non-empty sequence of **subfields**, each being a pair of **subfield code** (being a single character) and **subfield value** (being a string).

Fields with subfields, also called **variable fields**, MAY also have

* either two **indicators**, each being a single character,
* or an **occurrence**, being a sequence of two digits with positive numerical value (`01`, `02`, ...`99`).

The record model can further be restricted by a [format family].

The encoding of records in JSON or other individual serialization formats such as MARCXML, ISO 2709, or PICA JSON is out of the scope of this specification.

##### Example

Possible JSON serialization of a record with two flat fields with occurence and
one field with three subfields of code `g`, `g`, and `s`:

~~~json
[
  {
    "tag": "uri",
    "occurrence": "01",
    "value": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10953"
  },
  {
    "tag": "uri",
    "occurrence": "02"
    "value": "https://viaf.org/viaf/18236820"
  },
  {
    "tag": "name",
    "subfields": [
      "g", "Henriette",
      "g", "Davidson",
      "s", "Avram"
    ]
  }
}
~~~

### Format families

The [record model](#records) can be restricted by a **format family**, identified by a non-empty string. The following format families are part of this specification:

- `flat`: all fields are flat without indicators or occurrences (simple key-value structures with repeatable keys)

- `marc`: flat fields have no indicators or occurrences, variable fields have two indicators and no occurrences.
   Field tags are either the string `LDR` or a string of three digits.

- `pica`: all fields are variable without indicators. Field tags consist of four characters being
   a digit `0`, `1`, or `2`, followed by two digits, followed by an uppercase letter `A` to `Z` or `@`.

- `mab`: fields have one indicator and no occurrences. Field tags consist of three digits.

Restrictions on records by a format family imply [restrictions on schemas for this format family](#restrictions-by-format-family).

##### Example

Possible JSON serialization of a record of family `flat`, `marc`, and `pica`, respectively: 

~~~json
[
  { "tag": "given", "value": "Henriette" },
  { "tag": "given", "value": "Davidson" },
  { "tag": "surname", "value": "Avram" },
  { "tag": "birth", "value": "1919-10-07" }
]
~~~

~~~json
[
  { "tag": "LDR", "value": "00000nz  a2200000oc 4500" },
  { "tag": "001", "value": "1089521669" },
  { "tag": "100",
    "indicators" [ "1", " " ],
    "subfields": [
      "a", "Avram, Henriette D."
      "d", "1919-2006"
    ] }
]
~~~

~~~json
[
  { "tag": "003U", "subfields": [ "a", "http://d-nb.info/gnd/1089521669" ] },
  { "tag": "028A", "subfields": [ "d", "Henriette D.", "a", "Avram" ] },
  { "tag": "060R", "subfields": [ "a", "1919", "b", "2006", "4", "datl" ] }
]
~~~

## Schema format

[root level]: #schema-format

An **Avram Schema** is a JSON object given as serialized JSON document or any other format that encodes a JSON document. In contrast to [RFC 7159], all object keys MUST be unique. String values SHOULD NOT be the empty string. Applications MAY remove keys with empty string value.

A schema MUST contain key

* `fields` with a [field schedule](#field-schedule).

A schema SHOULD contain keys documenting the format defined by the schema:

* `title` with the name of the format
* `description` with a short description of the format
* `url` with a homepage URL of the format
* `family` with a [format family]
* `profile` with an URI of the format
* `language` with the language values of keys `title`, `description`, and `label` used throughout the schema. Its value SHOULD be assumed as `und` if not specified.

The schema MAY contain keys:

* `$schema` with an URL of the [Avram metaschema](#metaschema)
* `codelists` with a [codelist directory](#codelist)
* `checks` with [external validation rules](#external-validation-rules)
* `records` with a non-negative integer to indicate a number of records
* `created` with a timestamp when this schema was created
* `modified` with a timestamp when this schema was updated

##### Example

~~~json
{
  "fields": { },
  "title": "MARC 21 Format for Classification Data",
  "description": "MARC format for classification numbers and captions associated with them",
  "url": "https://www.loc.gov/marc/classification/",
  "profile": "http://format.gbv.de/marc/classification",
  "language": "en",
  "$schema": "https://format.gbv.de/schema/avram/schema.json"
}
~~~

### Field schedule

[field schedule]: #field-schedule

A **field schedule** is a JSON object that maps [field identifiers](#field-identifier) to [field definitons](#field-definition).

##### Example

~~~json
{
  "010": { "label": "Library of Congress Control Number" },
  "084": { "label": "Classification Scheme and Edition" }
}
~~~

Field identifiers of a field schedule SHOULD NOT overlap. Two field identifiers overlap when it is possible to match a field with both. Applications MUST either detect and reject overlapping field identifiers or match fields to the first of multiple overlapping field identifiers in alphabetical sort order.

### Field identifier

[field identifier]: #field-identifier
[field identifiers]: #field-identifier
[field counter]: #field-identifier
[field occurrence]: #field-identifier

A **field identifier** is a non-empty string that can be used to match fields. The identifier consists of a [tag], optionally followed by

* the slash (`/`) and a **field occurrence**, being a range of two digits except the single sequence of two digits (`00`),
* or the small letter x (`x`)  and a **field counter**, being a range of one or two digits (`0`, `0-1`..., `00`, `00-01`..., `98-99`).

Applications MAY further allow a tag followed by the slash and two zeroes (`/00`) as alias for a bare tag.

A [field] **matches** a field identifier if the tag of the field is equal to the tag of the field identifier, and

* the field has no occurrence and the field identifier has no field occurrence nor field counter,
* or the occurrence of the field matches the range of the field occurrence,
* or the first subfield value of subfield with subfield code `x` matches the range of the field counter.

##### Examples

* `LDR`, `001`, `850`... (MARC)
* `021A`, `045Q/01`, `028B/01-02`, `209K`, `209Ax00-09`, `247Ax0`... (PICA)
* `001`, `100`, `805`... (MAB)

### Field definition

[field definition]: #field-definition
[field definitions]: #field-definition

A **field definition** is a JSON object that SHOULD contain key:

* `tag` with the [tag]
* `label` with the name of the field
* `repeatable` with a boolean value, assumed as `false` by default
* `required` with a boolean value, assumed as `false` by default

The field definition MAY further contain keys:

* `occurrence` with a [field occurrence]
* `counter` with a [field counter]
* `url` with an URL link to documentation
* `description` with additional description of the field
* `indicator1` with first [indicator definition] or `null`
* `indicator2` with second [indicator definition] or `null`
* `pica3` with corresponding Pica3 number
* `created` with a timestamp when this field was introduced
* `modified` with a timestamp when this field was changed
* `positions` with a specification of [positions] (for flat fields)
* `pattern` with a regular expression (for flat fields)
* `codes` with a [codelist]
* `subfields` with a [subfield schedule] (for variable fields)
* `checks` with [external validation rules](#external-validation-rules)
* `total` with a non-negative integer to indicate the number of times this field has been found
* `records` with a non-negative integer to indicate the number of records this field has been found in

If a field definition contains keys for variable fields (`subfields`) it MUST NOT contain keys for flat fields (`positions`, `pattern` and/or `codes`).

If a field definition is given in a [field schedule], each of `tag`, `occurrence` and `counter` MUST either be missing or have same value as used to construct the corresponding [field identifier].

Applications MAY allow and remove `occurrence` keys with value two zeroes (`00`) as alias for a field definition without occurrence.

##### Example

*   MARC field `240` specified as mandatory and non-repeatable:

    ~~~json
    {
      "tag": "240",
      "label": "Uniform Title",
      "url": "https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd240.html",
      "required": true,
      "repeatable": false,
      "modified": "2017-12"
    }
    ~~~

*   PICA field `045B/02` in K10plus format

    ~~~json
    {
      "tag": "045B",
      "occurrence": "02",
      "pica3": "5022",
      "label": "Systematik f√ºr Bibliotheken (SfB)",
      "repeatable": true,
      "subfields": {
        "a": { "label": "Notation", "repeatable": true },
        "A": { "label": "Quelle", "repeatable": true }
      }
    }
    ~~~

### Positions

[positions]: #positions

Subfield values and flat field values can be specified **positions**, being a
JSON object that maps **character positions** to data **element definitions**.
A character position is a range. It is RECOMMENDED to use sequences of two digits.

A **data element definition** is a JSON object that SHOULD contain key:

* `label` with the name of the data element
* `start` with the start number of the character position
* `end` with the end number of the character position or the start number if there is no end number

The data element definition MAY further contain keys:

* `url` with an URL link to documentation
* `description` with additional description
* `codes` with a [codelist]
* `pattern` with a regular expression

Character positions of a positions object MUST NOT overlap. Two character positions overlap if there is a string that matches both of them.

##### Example

* Positions for MARC 21 field `005`:

    ~~~json
    {
      "00-03": { "label": "year", "start": 0, "end": 3 },
      "04-05": { "label": "month", "start": 4, "end": 5 },
      "06-07": { "label": "day", "start": 6, "end": 7 },
      "08-09": { "label": "hour", "start": 8, "end": 9 },
      "10-11": { "label": "minute", "start": 10, "end": 11 },
      "12-15": { "label": "second", "start": 12, "end": 15 }
    }
    ~~~

### Subfield schedule

[subfield schedule]: #subfield-schedule
[subfield schedules]: #subfield-schedule
[subfield definition]: #subfield-schedule

A **subfield schedule** is a JSON object that maps subfield codes to subfield
definitions.  A **subfield code** is a single character. A **subfield
definition** is a JSON object that SHOULD contain keys:

* `code` with the subfield code
* `label` with the name of the subfield
* `repeatable` with a boolean value, assumed as `false` by default
* `required` with a boolean value, assumed `false` by default

The subfield definition MAY further contain keys:

* `pattern` with a regular expression
* `positions` with a specification of [positions]
* `codes` with a [codelist]
* `checks` with [external validation rules](#external-validation-rules)
* `url` with an URL link to documentation
* `description` with additional description of the subfield
* `pica3` with a corresponding Pica3 syntax definition
* `created` with a timestamp when this subfield was introduced
* `modified` with a timestamp when this subfield was updated
* `total` with a non-negative integer to indicate the number of times this subfield has been found
* `records` with a non-negative integer to indicate the number of records this subfield has been found in

The subfield definition MAY but SHOULD NOT contain an additional, deprecated key

* `order` with a non-negative integer used to specify a partial or complete order of subfields

##### Example

*   Subfield schedule for MARC 21 bibliographic field `250` (Edition Statement):

    ~~~json
    {
      "a": {
        "label": "Edition statement",
        "repeatable": false,
        "pattern": "\\.$"
      },
      "b": {
        "label": "Remainder of edition statement",
        "repeatable": false
      },
      "3": {
        "label": "Materials specified",
        "repeatable": false
      },
      "6": {
        "label": "Field link and sequence number",
        "repeatable": true
      }
    }
    ~~~

### Indicator definition

[indicator definition]: #indicator-definition

An **indicator definition** is a JSON object that SHOULD contain key

* `label` with the name of the indicator

and further MAY contain keys:

* `url` with an URL link to documentation
* `description` with additional description of the indicator
* `codes` with a [codelist]

##### Example

~~~json
{
  "label": "Type",
  "codes": {
    " ": "Abbreviated key title",
    "0": "Other abbreviated title"
  }
}
~~~

### Codelist

[codelist]: #codelist
[code definition]: #code-definition

A **codelist** is 

- either a JSON object that maps codes to code definitions (**explicit codelist**)
- or a non-empty string that SHOULD be an URI (**codelist reference**).

A **code** is a non-empty string. A **code definition** is a JSON object with optional keys:

- `code` with the code
- `label` with the name of the code
- `description` with additional description of the code
- `created` with a timestamp when this code was introduced
- `modified` with a timestamp when this code was updated
- `total` with a non-negative integer to indicate the number of times this code has been found
- `records` with a non-negative integer to indicate the number of records this code has been found in

Optional key `code` of a code definition must be equal to the key of the code definition in its codelist.

An **extended codelist** is a JSON object having at least the mandatory key `codes` with a [codelist] and optional keys:

- `title` with a name of the codelist
- `description` with additional description of the codelist
- `created` with a timestamp when this codelist was introduced
- `modified` with a timestamp when this codelist was updated
- `url` with a homepage URL or link to documentation of the codelist

A **codelist directory** is a JSON object that maps codelist references to extended codelists. A codelist reference can be **resolved** by looking up its value as key in the codelist directory to get the corresponding extended codelist and its embedded explicit codelist.

##### Examples (explicit, reference, and codelist directory)

~~~json
{
  " ": {
    "label": "No specified type"
  },
  "a": {
    "label": "Archival",
    "created": "2022"
  },
  "x": {
    "code": "x"
  }
}
~~~

~~~json
"http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/languages"
~~~

~~~json
{
  "http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/languages": {
    "title": "MARC List for Languages",
    "codes": {
      "eng": { "label": "English" },
      "fre": { "label": "French" }
    }
  }
}
~~~

### External validation rules

An Avram Schema MAY include references to additional validation rules with key `checks` at the [root level], at [field schedules](#field-schedule), and at [subfield schedules] to check additional data types or integrity constraints. The value of this keys MUST be an string or a JSON array of strings. Strings SHOULD be URIs.

##### Example

~~~json
{
    "fields": {
        "birth": {
            "subfields": {
                "Y": { "label": "year" },
                "M": { "label": "month" },
                "D": { "label": "day" }
            },
            "checks": "http://example.org/valid-date"
        },
        "death": {
            "subfields": {
                "Y": { "label": "year" },
                "M": { "label": "month" },
                "D": { "label": "day" }
            },
            "checks": "http://example.org/valid-date"
        },
        "age": {
          "checks": "xsd:nonNegativeInteger"
        }
    },
    "checks": [
        "death must not be earlier than birth",
        "birth only allowed before 1950 for privacy reasons",
        "age must equal death minus birth, if given"
    ]
}
~~~

### Restrictions by format family

A format family restricts the [model of records](#records) than can be described by an Avram schema. Known values of schema key `family` imply restriction on [field identifiers](#field-identifier) and [field definitions](#field-definition).

#### flat formats

Field identifiers are plain tags. Field definitions MUST NOT include keys `occurrence`, `counter`, `indicator1`, `indicator2`, or `subfields`.

#### marc formats

Field identifiers are plain tags and MUST either be the string `LDR` or three digits. Field definitions MUST NOT include keys `occurrence` or `counter`. Field definitions of flat fields MUST NOT have keys `indicator1` or `indicator2`.

#### pica formats

Field identifiers MUST NOT include a [field counter] if its tag starts with digit `0` or `1` and MUST NOT include a [field occurrence] if its tag starts with digit `2`.Tags MUST match the regular expression `^[012][0-9][0-9][A-Z@]`. Field definitions MUST NOT include keys `indicator1` or `indicator2`.

#### mab formats

Field identifiers are plain tags and MUST consist of excactely three digits. Field definitions MUST NOT include keys `indicator2`, `occurrence`, or `counter`. 

### Metaschema

A [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) to validate Avram Schemas is available
at <https://format.gbv.de/schema/avram/schema.json>.

Applications MAY extend the metaschema for particular [format families](#records) and formats, for instance by further restriction of the allowed set of [field identifiers].

## Validation rules

Avram schemas can be used to validate [records] (see [record validation]). An Avram validator MAY limit validation to selected [format families](#record). Validation can be configured with [validation options](#validation-options). The validation rules are numbered below with codes from AR1 (read as "Avram Rule One") to AR24. Avram validators MUST implement rule AR1 to AR16 and MAY implement additional rules AR17 to AR24 for [counting] and [external rules](#validation-with-external-validation-rules).

- **[AR1]** a set of records is invalid against a schema, if any its records does not pass [record validation].

### Record validation

[record validation]: #record-validation

A record is valid against a [field schedule] if

- **[AR2]** every field matches a field identifier in the field schedule,

- **[AR3]** the record does not contain more than one field matching the same field definition with `repeatable` being `false`,

- **[AR4]** and the record contains at least one field for each field definition with `required` being `true`,

- **[AR5]** and every field is valid against its corresponding [field definition] from the field schedule (see [field validation]).

If validation option `ignore_unknown_fields` is enabled, all fields not matching a field identifier in the field schedule are valid by definition.

### Field validation

[field validation]: #field-validation
[Field validation]: #field-validation

A field is valid against a [field definition] if the following rules are met:

- **[AR6]** If the field is a flat field, its field value must be valid by [value validation].

- If the field is a variable field:
    - **[AR7]** every subfield has a corresponding [subfield definition]

    - **[AR8]** for subfield definitions with `repeatable` being `true`, the field MUST at most contain one subfield
    - **[AR9]** for subfield definitions with `required` being `true`, the field MUST contain at least one subfield
    - **[AR10]** every subfield value is valid by [value validation] against its corresponding [subfield definition]

- **[AR11]** If the field contains indicators, their values must be valid by [value validation] against the corresponding [indicator definition] `indicator1` (first indicator) and `indicator2` (second indicator) not being `null`.

Field validation of variable fields can be configured:

- to not validate subfields (`ignore_subfields`)
- to ignore subfields not defined in the schema (`ignore_unknown_subfields`)

Tag and occurrence of a field are not included in field validation as they are part of [record validation](#record-validation).

### Value validation

[value validation]: #value-validation
[Value validation]: #value-validation

A value (given as string), is valid if it conforms to a definition (given as [field definition], [subfield definition], [indicator definition], [data element definition](#positions)):

- **[AR12]** if the definition contains key `pattern`, the value must match its regular expression. The pattern is not anchored by default, so `^` and/or `$` must be included to match start and/or end of the value.

- **[AR13]** if the definition contains key `positions`, the value must be [valid against its positions](#validation-with-positions).

- **[AR14]** if the definition contains key `codes`, the value must be [valid against its codelist](#validation-with-codelists)

A value is always valid if the definition contains neither of keys `pattern`, `positions`, and `codes`.

If validation option `ignore_values` is enabled, all non-indicator values are valid.

### Validation with positions

[validation with positions]: #validation-with-positions
[Validation with positions]: #validation-with-positions

A string value is valid against [positions](#positions) if all substrings defined by character positions of the positions are valid against the corresponding data element definitions. Character positions are counted by Unicode code points.

Substrings can be empty, for instance when the value is shorter than some character position. An empty substring can be valid, depending on the data element definition.

Positions can recursively contain other positions via their data element definitions.

### Validation with codelists

[validation with codelists]: #validation-with-codelists
[Validation with codelists]: #validation-with-codelists

- **[AR15]** A string value is valid against an [explicit codelist](#codelist) if the value is a defined code in this codelist.

- **[AR16]** A string value is valid against a [codelist reference](#codelist) if the codelist reference can be resolved and the value is defined in the resolved explicit codelist.

Applications MAY also resolve codelist references against externally defined explicit codelists by implicitly extending the codelist directory of the schema. If so, the application MUST make clear whether codelists directly defined in the codelist directory are overriden or extened.

Validation can further be configured:

- to not validate against codelists (`ignore_codes`)
- to not validate against codelist references if the corresponding explicit codelist cannot be found (`ignore_unknown_codelists`)

### Counting

[Counting]: #counting

Avram schemas can also be used to give or expect a number of elements with keys `records` at [root level] and keys `records` and `total` at [field definitions], [subfield definitions](#subfield-schedule) and [code definitions](#codelist). By default these keys are ignore during validation.

Validation of a set of records can be configured to not ignore these fields but to compare given given numbers to the actual number of records, fields, subfields, and/or codes found in the records. Validation options to enable counting are:

- `count_records` to enable counting the total number of records,
   and the total numbers or records each field with a [field definition],
   each subfield with a [subfield definition], and each code with
   a [code definition](#codelist) is found in.

- `count_fields` to enable counting the total number each field from the [field schedule] is found

- `count_subfields` to enable counting the total number each subfield field from a [subfield schedule] is found

- `count_codes` to enable counting the total number of each code from a [codelist] is found

Support of counting in Avram validators is OPTIONAL. If selected counting options are supported and enabled, then the following validation rules must be respected:

- **[AR17]** the number of validated records MUST be equal to the value of schema key `records` if this key exist (enabled with option `count_records`).

- **[AR18]** if a [field definition] of the schema includes key `records` then the number of input records with this field MUST be equal to the number given by this key (enabled by combination of option `count_records` and `count_fields`).

- **[AR19]** if a [subfield definition] of the schema includes key `records` then the number of input records with a field with this subfield MUST be equal to the number given by this key (enabledby combination of option `count_records` and `count_subfields`).

- **[AR20]** if a [code definition] of the schema includes key `records` then the number of input records this code is used in MUST be equal to the number given by this key (enabled by combination of option `count_records` and `count_codes`).

- **[AR21]** if a [field definition] of the schema includes key `total` then the total number this field is contained in input records MUST be equal to the number given by this key (enbaled by option `count_fields`).

- **[AR22]** if a [subfield definition] of the schema includes key `total` then the total number this subfield is contained in input records MUST be equal to the number given by this key (enbaled by option `count_subfields`).

- **[AR23]** if a [code definition] of the schema includes key `total` then the total number this code is contained in input records MUST be equal to the number given by this key (enbaled by option `count_codes`).

### Validation with external validation rules

By default [external validation rules](#external-validatio-rules) are ignored for validation. Optional validation option `check_rules` enforces an Avram validator to process all external rules and reject input data as invalid if a rule cannot be checked **[AR24]**.

### Validation options

An Avram validator MAY support selected validation options to configure how validation rules are applied. All options MUST be disabled by default and if not supported. An Avram validator MUST document which options it supports. The following validation options are defined:

Option | Aspect | Implication
-------|--------|------------
`ignore_unknown_fields` | [record validation] | ignore fields without field definition
`ignore_subfields` | [field validation] | ignore subfields
`ignore_unknown_subfields` | [field validation] | ignore subfields without subfield definition
`ignore_values` | [value validation] | ignore all flat field values and subfield values
`ignore_codes` | [validation with codelists] | don't validate with codelists
`ignore_unknown_codelists` | [validation with codelists] | don't validate with unresolveable codelist reference
`count_records`| [counting] | count and compare number of records
`count_fields`| [counting] | count and compare number of defined fields
`count_subfields`| [counting] | count and compare number of defined subfields
`count_codes`| [counting] | count and compare number of defined codes
`check_rules` | [external rules](#validation-with-external-rules) | all external rules must be respected
