## Introduction

MARC and related formats such as PICA and MAB are used since decades as the basis for library automation. Several variants, dialects and profiles exist for different applications. The Avram schema language allows to specify individual formats for documentation, validation, and requirements engineering. The schema language is named after [Henriette D. Avram (1919-2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henriette_Avram) who devised MARC as the first automated cataloging system in the 1960s.

The Avram specification consists of a [schema format](#schema-format) based on JSON and [validation rules](#validation-rules) to validate [records] against individual schemas. The format can also be used to express results of record analysis.

The document is managed in a git repository at <https://github.com/gbv/avram> together with test files for implementations.

### Conformance requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

### Data types

A **timestamp** is a date or datetime as defined with XML Schema datatype [datetime](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime) (`-?YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss(\.s+)?(Z|[+-]hh:mm)?`) [date](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#date) (`-?YYYY-MM-DD(Z|[+-]hh:mm)?`), [gYearMonth](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#gYearMonth) (`-?YYYY-MM`), or [gYear](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#gYear) (`-?YYYY`).

A **regular expression** is a string that conforms to the [ECMA 262 (2015) regular expression grammar](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-patterns).  The expression is interpreted as Unicode pattern.

A **language** is a natural language identifier as defined with XML Schema datatype [language](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#language).

A **non-negative integer** is a natural number (0, 1, 2...)

A **range** is a sequence of digits, optionally followed by a dash (`-`) and a second sequence of digits with same length and numerical value larger than the first sequence (examples: `0`, `00`, `3-7`, `03-12`, `01-09`...). A string **matches** a range if it is a sequence of digits of same length as the sequence(s) in the range and the numerical value is equal to or between the numerical value(s) of the range. Applications MAY accept and normalize two sequences of different length to valid ranges.

### Records

[records]: #records
[record]: #records
[field]: #records
[tag]: #records
[occurrence]: #records

Avram schemas are used to [validate](#validation-rules) and analyze records. A **record** is a non-empty sequence of **fields**, each consisting of a **tag**, being a non-empty string and

* either a **fixed field value**, being a non-empty string,
* or a non-empty sequence of **subfields**, each being a pair of **subfield code** (being a character) and **subfield value** (being a non-empty string).

Fields with subfields, also called **variable fields** MAY also have

* either two **indicators**, each being a single character,
* or an **occurrence**, being a sequence of two digits with positive numerical value (`01`, `02`, ...`99`).

The encoding of records in individual serialization formats such as MARCXML, ISO 2709, or PICA JSON is out of the scope of this specification.

## Schema format

[root level]: #schema-format

An **Avram Schema** is a JSON object given as serialized JSON document or any other format that encodes a JSON document. In contrast to [RFC 7159], all object keys MUST be unique. String values SHOULD NOT be the empty string. Applications MAY remove keys with empty string value.

A schema MUST contain key

* `fields` with a [field schedule](#field-schedule).

A schema SHOULD contain keys documenting the format defined by the schema:

* `title` with the name of the format
* `description` with a short description of the format
* `url` with a homepage URL of the format
* `profile` with an URI of the format
* `language` with the language values of keys `title`, `description`, and `label` used throughout the schema. Its value SHOULD be assumed as `und` if not specified.

The schema MAY contain keys:

* `$schema` with an URL of the [Avram metaschema](#metaschema)
* `deprecated-fields` with a [field schedule]
* `codelists` with a [codelist directory](#codelist)
* `checks` with [external validation rules](#external-validation-rules)
* `records` with a non-negative integer to indicate a number of records

##### Example

~~~json
{
  "fields": { },
  "title": "MARC 21 Format for Classification Data",
  "description": "MARC format for classification numbers and captions associated with them",
  "url": "https://www.loc.gov/marc/classification/",
  "profile": "http://format.gbv.de/marc/classification",
  "language": "en",
  "$schema": "https://format.gbv.de/schema/avram/schema.json"
}
~~~

### Field schedule

[field schedule]: #field-schedule

A **field schedule** is a JSON object that maps [field identifiers](#field-identifier) to [field definitons](#field-definition).

##### Example

~~~json
{
  "010": { "label": "Library of Congress Control Number" },
  "084": { "label": "Classification Scheme and Edition" }
}
~~~

Field identifiers of a field schedule SHOULD NOT overlap. Two field identifiers overlap when it is possible to match a field with both. Applications MUST remove field identifiers and corresponding definitions to remove overlap of field identifiers.

### Field identifier

[field identifier]: #field-identifier
[field identifiers]: #field-identifier
[field counter]: #field-counter
[field occurrence]: #field-occurrence

A **field identifiers** is a non-empty string that can be used to match fields. The identifier consists of a [tag], optionally followed by

* the slash (`/`) and a **field occurrence**, being a range of two digits except the single sequence of two digits (`00`),
* or the small letter x (`x`)  and a **field counter**, being a range of one or two digits (`0`, `0-1`..., `00`, `00-01`..., `98-99`).

Applications MAY further allow a tag followed by the slash and two zeroes (`/00`) as alias for a bare tag.

A [field] **matches** a field identifier if the tag of the field is equal to the tag of the field identifier, and

* the field has no occurrence and the field identifier has no field occurrence nor field counter,
* or the occurrence of the field matches the range of the field occurrence,
* or the first subfield value of subfield with subfield code `x` matches the range of the field counter. 

##### Examples

* `LDR`, `001`, `850`... (MARC)
* `021A`, `045Q/01`, `028B/01-02`, `209K`, `209Ax00-09`, `247Ax0`... (PICA)
* `001`, `100`, `805`... (MAB)

### Field definition

[field definition]: #field-definition
[field definitions]: #field-definition

A **field definition** is a JSON object that SHOULD contain key:

* `tag` with the [tag]
* `label` with the name of the field
* `repeatable` with a boolean value, assumed as `false` by default
* `required` with a boolean value, assumed as `false` by default

The field definition MAY further contain keys:

* `occurrence` with a [field occurrence]
* `counter` with a [field counter]
* `url` with an URL link to documentation
* `description` with additional description of the field
* `indicator1` with first [indicator definition] or `null`
* `indicator2` with second [indicator definition] or `null`
* `pica3` with corresponding Pica3 number
* `modified` with a timestamp
* `positions` with a specification of [positions] (for fixed fields)
* `subfields` with a [subfield schedule] (for variable fields)
* `deprecated-subfields` with a [subfield schedule] (for variable fields)
* `checks` with [external validation rules](#external-validation-rules)
* `total` with a non-negative integer to indicate the number of times this field has been found
* `records` with a non-negative integer to indicate the number of records this field has been found in

A field definition MUST NOT contain both keys for fixed fields (`position`) and keys for variable fields (`subfields` and/or `deprecated-subfields`) together.

If a field definition is given in a [field schedule], each of `tag`, `occurrence` and `counter` MUST either be missing or have same value as used to construct the corresponding [field identifier].

Applications MAY allow and remove `occurrence` keys with value two zeroes (`00`) as alias for a field definition without occurrence.

##### Example

*   MARC field `240` specified as mandatory and non-repeatable:

    ~~~json
    {
      "tag": "240",
      "label": "Uniform Title",
      "url": "https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd240.html",
      "required": true,
      "repeatable": false,
      "modified": "2017-12"
    }
    ~~~

*   PICA field `045B/02` in K10plus format

    ~~~json
    {
      "tag": "045B",
      "occurrence": "02",
      "pica3": "5022",
      "label": "Systematik f√ºr Bibliotheken (SfB)",
      "repeatable": true,
      "subfields": {
        "a": { "label": "Notation", "repeatable": true },
        "A": { "label": "Quelle", "repeatable": true }
      }
    }
    ~~~

### Positions

[positions]: #positions

Subfield values and fixed field values can be specified **positions**, being a
JSON object that maps **character positions** to data **element definitions**.
A character position is a range not consisting of zeroes only. It is
RECOMMENDED to use sequences of two digits.

A **data element definition** is a JSON object that SHOULD contain key:

* `label` with the name of the data element

The data element definition MAY further contain keys:

* `url` with an URL link to documentation
* `description` with additional description
* `codes` with a [codelist]
* `deprecated-codes` with a [codelist] of deprecated codes
* `pattern` with a regular expression

##### Example

* Positions for MARC 21 field `005`:

    ~~~json
    {
      "00-03": { "label": "year" },
      "04-05": { "label": "month" },
      "06-07": { "label": "day" },
      "08-09": { "label": "hour" },
      "10-11": { "label": "minute" },
      "12-15": { "label": "second" }
    }
    ~~~

### Subfield schedule

[subfield schedule]: #subfield-schedule
[subfield schedules]: #subfield-schedule
[subfield definition]: #subfield-schedule

A **subfield schedule** is a JSON object that maps subfield codes to subfield
definitions.  A **subfield code** is a single character. A **subfield
definition** is a JSON object that SHOULD contain keys:

* `code` with the subfield code
* `label` with the name of the subfield
* `repeatable` with a boolean value, assumed as `false` by default
* `required` with a boolean value, assumed `false` by default

The subfield definition MAY further contain keys:

* `pattern` with a regular expression
* `positions` with a specification of [positions]
* `codes` with a [codelist]
* `deprecated-codes` with a [codelist] of deprecated codes
* `checks` with [external validation rules](#external-validation-rules)
* `url` with an URL link to documentation
* `description` with additional description of the subfield
* `order` with a non-negative integer used to specify a partial or complete order
  of subfields
* `pica3` with a corresponding Pica3 syntax definition
* `modified` with a timestamp
* `total` with a non-negative integer to indicate the number of times this subfield has been found
* `records` with a non-negative integer to indicate the number of records this subfield has been found in

##### Example

*   Subfield schedule for MARC 21 bibliographic field `250` (Edition Statement):

    ~~~json
    {
      "a": {
        "label": "Edition statement",
        "repeatable": false,
        "pattern": "\\.$"
      },
      "b": {
        "label": "Remainder of edition statement",
        "repeatable": false
      },
      "3": {
        "label": "Materials specified",
        "repeatable": false
      },
      "6": {
        "label": "Field link and sequence number",
        "repeatable": true
      }
    }
    ~~~

### Indicator definition

[indicator definition]: #indicator-definition

An **indicator definition** is a JSON object that SHOULD contain key

* `label` with the name of the indicator

and further MAY contain keys:

* `url` with an URL link to documentation
* `description` with additional description of the indicator
* `codes` with a [codelist]
* `deprecated-codes` with a [codelist] of deprecated codes

##### Example

~~~json
{
  "label": "Type",
  "codes": {
    " ": "Abbreviated key title",
    "0": "Other abbreviated title"
  }
}
~~~

### Codelist

[codelist]: #codelist

A **codelist** is 

* either a JSON object that maps codes to code definitions (**explicit codelist**)
* or an URI (**referenced codelist**).

A **code** is a non-empty string. A **code definition** is a JSON object with optional keys:

* `label` with the name of the code
* `description` with additional description of the code
* `total` with a non-negative integer to indicate the number of times this code has been found
* `records` with a non-negative integer to indicate the number of records this code has been found in

A **codelist directory** is a JSON object that maps referenced codelists to explicit codelists.

##### Examples (explicit, referenced, and truncated codelist directory)

~~~json
{
  " ": {
    "label": "No specified type"
  },
  "a": {
    "label": "Archival"
  },
  "x": { }
}
~~~

~~~json
"http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/languages"
~~~

~~~json
{
  "http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/languages": {
    "eng": { "label": "English" },
    "fre": { "label": "French" }
  }
}
~~~

### External validation rules

An Avram Schema MAY include references to additional validation rules with key `checks` at the [root level], at [field schedules](#field-schedule), and at [subfield schedules]. The value of this keys MUST be an string or a JSON array of strings. Strings SHOULD be URIs.

##### Example

~~~json
{
    "fields": {
        "birth": {
            "subfields": {
                "Y": { "label": "year" },
                    "M": { "label": "month" },
                    "D": { "label": "day" }
            },
                "checks": "http://example.org/valid-date"
        },
            "death": {
                "subfields": {
                    "Y": { "label": "year" },
                    "M": { "label": "month" },
                    "D": { "label": "day" }
                },
                "checks": "http://example.org/valid-date"
            }
    },
        "checks": [
            "death must not be earlier than birth",
        "birth only allowed before 1950 for privacy reasons"
        ]
}
~~~

### Additional rules for MARC-based formats

* [field definitions](#field-definition) MUST NOT include the keys `occurrence`, `counter`, `pica3`.
* tags of a field definition or [field identifier] MUST either be the character sequence `LDR` for specification of the record leader, or consist of three digits (e.g. `001`).

### Additional rules for PICA-based formats

* field definitions MUST NOT include the keys `indicator1` and `indicator2`.
* tags of a field identifier and field definition MUST be three digits, the first `0` to `2`, followed by an uppercase letter (`A` to `Z`) or `@`.
* field identifiers and field definitions MUST NOT include a [field occurence] if tag start with digit `2`.
* field identifier and field definition MUST NOT include a [field counter] if tag does not start with digit `2`.

### Metaschema

A [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) to validate Avram Schemas is available
at <https://format.gbv.de/schema/avram/schema.json>.

Applications MAY extend the metaschema for particular formats, for instance the
further restrict the allowed set of [field identifiers].

## Validation rules

*Rules how to validate records against Avram Schemas have not fully been specified yet!*

Parts of an Avram schema can be used to validate and analyze [records].

### Record validation

A record is valid if:

    * every field matches a corresponding [field definition]
* every field is valid (see [field validation](#field-validation)
        * and there is at least one field for each [field definition] with `required` being `true`

        Validation of a record can be configured:

        * to ignore fields without field definition (`ignore_unknown_fields`)
        * to allow fields defined as deprecated in the schemas (`allow_deprecated_fields`)

### Field validation

A field is valid if it conforms to its corresponding [field definition]:

* if `repeatable` is `false` the field is valid only if the record does not contain another field with the same field definition.
* every subfield has a [subfield definition] and is valid
* there is at least one subfield for each [subfield definition] with `required` being `true`

Field validation can be configured:

* to ignore subfields not defined in the schema (`ignore_unknown_subfields`)
* to allow subfields defined as deprecated in the schemas (`allow_deprecated_fields`)

### Subfield validation

A subfield is valid if it conforms to its corresponding [subfield definition]:

* if `repeatable` is `false` the subfield is valid only if the field does not contain another subfield with the same subfield code.
* Subfield value matches given `pattern`, `positions`, and/or `codes`

Subfield validation can be configured:

* to not validate subfields (`ignore_subfields`)
* to ignore subfield values (`ignore_subfield_values`)
* to ignore order of subfields (`ignore_subfield_order`)

### Validation against a codelist

A string value is valid against an [explicit codelist](#codelist) if the value is a defined code in this codelist. To check whether a string value is valid against a referenced codelist, the codelist is resolved with the codelist directory of the Avram schema. Applications MAY resolve referenced codelists against externally defined explicit codelists. If so, the application MUST make clear whether codelists defined in the codelist directory are overriden or extened. 

Validation can further be configured to not validate against referenced codelists if the corresponding explicit codelist cannot be found (`ignore_unknown_codelists`).

## Counting

An Avram schema can contain key `records` at [root level] and keys `records` and `total` at [field definitions], [subfield definitions](#subfield-schedule) and [code definitions](#codelist). Validation can be configured to not ignore these fields butto compare given counting fields to the actual number of records, subfields, and/or codes found in input data. Konfiguration keys are:

* `count_records` to enable counting number of records (key `records` at root level)
* `count_fields` to enable counting number of each field (keys `records` and `total` at field definitions)
* `count_subfields` to enable counting number of each subfield (keys `records` and `total` at subfield definitions)
* `count_codes` to enable counting number of each code (key `records` and `total` ad code definitions)

Enabling `count_subfields` implies `count_fields` and enabling `count_fields` or `count_codes` implies `count_records`.
